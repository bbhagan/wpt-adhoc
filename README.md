# WebPageTest Adhoc Testing tool

This will run tests against [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/) private instance.

## What it does

## How it does it

## Setup requirements

-- You'll need a [WebPageTest Server and client](https://github.com/WPO-Foundation). You can implement this in a docker container, on Amazon EC2, Google Cloud, on a spare server, etc. They've made it really easy to deploy a private instance of WPT.
-- You'll need node and npm running on your development server (most recent node reccommended.)

## Setup .env for your environment

Modify the .env file at the root of the project to match your settings

## Run the application

You can start up the application in development mode using npm run dev
